[Nokul](https://github.com/omu/nokul) aims to become a complete solution for universities that face many challanges while trying to manage all the complex procedures of a university online.

Dealing with ill-structured processes of a university is hard, especially when they backed with complex legal procedures. Many universities facing similar issues when it comes to automating things, and moving face-to-face operations to online. Nokul aims to remediate these wounds by taking a Turkish university with more than 70 web services, 50K students and 4K employees as a case.
