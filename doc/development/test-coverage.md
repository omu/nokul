Test Coverage
=============

Currently coverage reports are being send to Codacy automatically in CI environment. If you would like to generate a
local report for yourself (using SimpleCov), you simply need to run tests and view the generated file in
`coverage/index.html.erb`:

```ruby
rake test
```
